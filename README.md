#SZ_effect
Data analysis / Planck 2015
Using ILC method to extract thermal Sunyaevâ€“Zel'dovich effect maps from Planck HFI data.

Use HFI maps (2048) of Planck mission and the PSZ2v1.fits catalog available on SZ Cluster DataBase (IAS/IDOC).

HFI_SkyMap_*.fits --> /SZ_effect/maps_2015
PSZ2v1.fits  --> /SZ_effect

--> Run smooth_psf.py 
    to smooth each map as a function of the worst resolution (100 GHz).

--> Run find_SZE.py [-h] [-p] n_cluster
    to extract patch map from the data where the PSZ2 catalog indicate the presence of galaxy cluster.
    We select the clusters based on the weight/latidude function and we save *.fits in patch_SZ/SZ directory.  
    (see report for details)

--> Run apert_phot.py 
    to applied aperture photometry on the extracted patchs and compute the radial profiles and flux of each cluster.
    The different plots are saved in the /results directory.
