#SZ_effect
Data analysis / Planck 2015
Using ILC method to extract thermal Sunyaevâ€“Zel'dovich effect maps from Planck HFI data.

Use HFI maps (2048) of Planck mission and the PSZ2v1.fits catalog available on SZ Cluster DataBase (IAS/IDOC).

## Files to update
HFI_SkyMap_*.fits --> /SZ_effect/maps_2015

PSZ2v1.fits  --> /SZ_effect

galacticMask.fits

## Procedure
> Run smooth_psf.py -- to smooth each map as a function of the worst resolution (100 GHz).

> Run find_SZE.py [-h] [-p] [-m] n_cluster --
to extract patch map from the data where the PSZ2 catalog indicate the presence of galaxy cluster.
We select the clusters based on the weight/latitude function and we save *.fits in patch_SZ/SZ directory.  
(see report for details)

> Run apert_phot.py -- 
to applied aperture photometry on the extracted patchs and compute the radial profiles and flux of each cluster.
The different plots are saved in the /results directory.
